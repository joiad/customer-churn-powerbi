# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze customer churn patterns and key drivers behind customer retention.
Using a dataset of over 10,000 customer records, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover actionable insights. The analysis explored churn by contract type, monthly charges, tenure, and service usage. 
The dashboard highlights correlations between short customer tenure, higher charges, and increased churn rates. It also identifies customer segments with a higher likelihood of leaving.
The goal of this analysis is to support data-driven decision-making by providing clear visuals and KPIs that help stakeholders reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
